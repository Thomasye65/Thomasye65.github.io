            Brief Biography of William Golding
        </ul>
    </h2>
    <ul>
        William Golding's parents brought him up to be a scientist. But he always had an interest in reading and writing,
         and at Oxford University he shifted from the sciences to literature. Golding fought in World War II, and was involved 
         in the D-Day landing at Normandy. His experience in the war greatly influenced his views of human nature. After the war, 
         he began writing novels in addition to teaching. Lord of the Flies was Golding's first novel, published in 1954, and was a 
         critically acclaimed bestseller in both England and the United States. Though Golding never again achieved the same commercial 
         success, he continued to write and went on to publish many more novels, including The Scorpion God (1971), Darkness Visible (1979),
          and Fire Down Below (1989). He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1983 and died in 1993.

    <h2>
        <ul>
            Historical Context of Lord of the Flies
        </ul>
    </h2>
    <ul>
        World War II influenced the themes and 
        setting of Lord of the Flies. The war c
        hanged the way people in general and Wi
        lliam Golding in particular viewed the wo
        rld. World War I was for many years cal
        led the War to End All Wars. World War 
        II proved that idea wrong and created a
         new sense that people are inherently w
         arlike, power hungry, and savage. Whil
         e the world war raging in Lord of the 
          Flies is not World War II, it can be v
         iewed as Golding's version of World Wa
         r III. Only a few brief references to 
         the war outside the boys' island appea
         r in the novel, but references to an a
         tom bomb blowing up an airport and the
          "Reds" make it clear that the war inv
          olves nuclear weapons and places capi
          talist allies including the British a
          gainst the communist "Reds."

            Other Books Related to Lord of the Flies
        </ul>
    </h2>
    <ul>
        Adventure stories such as Robinson Crusoe and
         Swiss Family Robinson depict people who are s
         tranded on deserted islands transforming and
          civilizing nature. Lord of the Flies subvert
          s the genre. It shows boys stranded on an is
          land who try to civilize nature, but instead
           descend into savagery. While other adventur
           e novels support the idea that man is inher
           ently civilized, Lord of the Flies uses the 
           genre to suggest exactly the opposite.
